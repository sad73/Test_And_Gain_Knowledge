Hey,
I’ve set up a deliberately vulnerable web application for educational and ethical hacking practice.
🧪 Test site link:
👉 http://testmekidde.onlinewebshop.net/
This site includes common vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, and insecure form handling. 
It is intended for practicing and learning web application security techniques only.

⚠️ Important Note:
Do NOT enter any real or sensitive information.
Use fake/dummy data while creating an account or entering any form.
This site is intentionally insecure and should only be used in a controlled or isolated environment.
Use it responsibly and legally. 👨‍💻🔐
